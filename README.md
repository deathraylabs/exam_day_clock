# exam_day_clock
I like to display a large clock on the projector during in-class exams but don't really care for the sites that offer free presentation clocks online. The online clocks are usually too cluttered or have distracting advertisements and are inappropriate for exams. Additionally, I want a clock that indicates the amount of time remaining, that way students have a feeling for where they should be in their test at any given time.

## file descriptions:
**HTML 5 analog clock example.html** — this is example javascript code I found using a google search but forgot to write down the reference link to.

**notes with clock.html** — web page I use to display exam information to the class during an examination

**test_day.css** — separate style sheet for the display page

**test_day.js** — javascript code used to generate the clock
